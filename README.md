# Block the Loop

**Block the Loop** is a project born from frustration, love and deep saddness.

Mobile games are engineered to trap players in psychological loops — reward cycles, time-gated upgrades, alliance pressure, and endless microtransactions. These loops are designed to be compulsive, monetized, and hard to escape.

This repository exists to help you — or someone you care about — break that loop.

## 🎯 Purpose

Whether you're trying to support a loved one, protect a child, or escape the grind yourself, this blocklist offers a technical layer of defense. It targets infrastructure domains used by the most addictive mobile games across genres and publishers.

But let’s be clear: **blocking is not healing**.

## 🧩 One Piece of the Puzzle

This repo is a tool — not a cure.

If you or someone close to you is struggling with mobile game addiction, please consider:
- Talking to a mental health professional
- Exploring digital wellness tools
- Setting device-level limits and boundaries
- Seeking community support

Technical intervention can interrupt harmful patterns. But healing takes time, support, and self-compassion.

## 🧱 Structure

- `publishers/` — Organized by game publisher (e.g. Lilith Games, FunPlus, King)
- Each folder contains:
  - `blocklist.txt` — Wildcard domains for Pi-hole, NextDNS, etc.
  - `README.md` — Game coverage, scope, and usage notes

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo does not block ads, trackers, or third-party integrations. It focuses strictly on game infrastructure. Blocking may break login, updates, or gameplay. Use with care and test per title.
